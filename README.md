Digital IC Design Journey with Cadence Virtuoso
This repository documents my hands-on journey in Digital IC Design using Cadence Virtuoso, focusing on the complete Schematic-to-GDSII flow while working on 45nm CMOS technology.

Over this learning journey, I have explored the full custom design process step by step ‚Äî from transistor-level schematics to layout creation, design rule checks (DRC), layout-versus-schematic verification (LVS), and parasitic extraction (AV_Extracted view).

üîç Key Focus Areas:
MOSFET-Level Circuit Design: Understanding and designing with NMOS/PMOS devices.

DC & Transient Analysis: Performing simulations to verify functional and performance-level behavior under different operating conditions.

Hierarchical Design Modeling: Building complex logic gates like NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR using modular approaches for scalability and clarity.

Layout Optimization: Improving efficiency by sharing diffusion (source/drain), overlapping connections to reduce area, and minimizing parasitics.

Parasitic Extraction & Comparison: Analyzing how extracted parasitics affect rise/fall times, delay, and overall performance.

Tool Familiarity: Working across Cadence Virtuoso environment and exploring other EDA tools such as Synopsys Custom Compiler for cross-platform learning.

üß† Learning Goals:
Build an industry-ready skill set in full-custom VLSI design.

Understand how layout choices affect performance.

Develop efficient and reusable design hierarchies.

Gain deep insight into the practical behavior of MOS circuitry under real-world constraints.
