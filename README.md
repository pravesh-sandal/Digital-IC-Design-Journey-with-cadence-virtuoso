&nbsp;  **Day📝       | Task Description |**



* Day 1	Introduction to Cadence Virtuoso and 45nm technology
* Day 2	Designed basic logic gates (NOT, AND, OR) – schematic level
* Day 3	Created symbols and started layout for basic gates
* Day 4	Completed AND gate layout and ran DRC checks
* Day 5	Performed LVS for AND gate and fixed connectivity issues
* Day 6	Designed XOR gate schematic using CMOS logic
* Day 7	Layout of XOR gate and DRC clean
* Day 8	LVS passed for XOR, moved to Half Adder schematic
* Day 9	Half Adder layout and parasitic extraction
* Day 10	Post-layout simulation of Half Adder 


**🛠 Tools Used**

* Cadence Virtuoso – Schematic/Layout Editor
* Spectre – Simulation
* Assura or Calibre – DRC, LVS, PEX
* 45nm CMOS PDK


**🎯 Objective**

To master the full-custom VLSI design flow by applying transistor-level knowledge to real-world digital circuits, and building a verified, layout-ready IP library.
