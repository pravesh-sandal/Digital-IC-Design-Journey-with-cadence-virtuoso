On Day 1, I explored the Virtuoso design environment, understood the basics of CMOS technology, and focused on:

Creating the schematic for an NMOS transistor

Performing DC analysis to study NMOS behavior

Running a parametric sweep by varying V<sub>GS</sub>

Analyzing the I<sub>DS</sub> vs V<sub>DS</sub> characteristics

📂 Includes:

📓 Notes on CMOS and Virtuoso

🖼️ Screenshots of schematics and simulation

🔍 DC Analysis Results
